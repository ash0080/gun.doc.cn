Not all adapters are created equal, and you will need to choose an adapter to best suite you're application's needs.

By default, Gun dumps it's graph into localStorage on the browser and into a flat file in Node environments.

The flat file is _not_ meant for production, and the primary reason is performance at scale. Once you're graph becomes larger, it will not (and is not intended) to keep up with production IO requirements.

# Key Considerations

* Are updates or creates more important?
* How large are your nodes? Keep in mind that anything created by a `set` is just building up a node over time.

# How Benchmarks Work

Benchmarks include four operations on nodes of 3 sizes:

**Operations:**
* Create `n` nodes
* Read `n` nodes
* Full re-write `n` nodes
* Update single property on `n` nodes

**Node sizes:**

* Small nodes: 10 properties each
* Medium nodes: 1,000 properties each
* Large nodes: 10,000 properties each

# Running Benchmarks

Currently, please reference this repo: [github](https://github.com/sjones6/gun-adapter-perf).

In the near future, a CLI tool will be released and documented to make this easy.

`gun-flint` is bundled with such a tool already, and so adapters build on flint can take advantage of this. See flint's [documentation](https://github.com/sjones6/gun-flint/blob/master/docs/PERFORMANCE_TESTING.MD).

# Future work

These benchmarks are by and large put together by the good folks creating the storage adapters, so their benchmarks reflect the system that they ran the tests on. In the future, we plan on being able to run these on a system with the same specs.

We need benchmarks for:

* standard file adapter
* gun-level
* gun-file
* complete suite for gun-mongo
