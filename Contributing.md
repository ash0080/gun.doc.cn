## Write Adaptors and Extensions

Specific instructions to come, but come over to [gitter](https://gitter.im/amark/gun) forums and hit us up with questions, or check out some of the sample [extensions and adaptors](Awesome-GUN) currently in the wild.

## Contribute to the Documentation

> NOTE: There is currently a bounty program to incentivize common tasks, such as writing documentation. Take a minute to read about it [over here](Bounty).

All current documentation lives at [https://gun.eco/docs/](https://gun.eco/docs/)

There are two ways to contribute to the documentation:

### 1) Live Edit

Just head over to any page on the live [documentation site](https://gun.eco/docs/), and click the "Edit this page" button in the top right corner. That will fork a specific page for editing purposes on GitHub.

### 2) Fork the Wiki

We use GitHub's Wiki to manage documentation, which is managed through a `.wiki.git` repository. Unfortunately, you can't typically use the GitHub user interface for pull requests to the origin Wiki.

Luckily, GitHub has [provided a workaround](http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2016/07/enabling-pull-requests-on-github-wikis.html). We are still in the process of setting this up, but when things are ready, we'll update the documentation here. In the meantime, come make yourself known on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/amark/gun). Maybe you can help this along!

<!-- You can now make changes, commit, push, and do pull requests to the Gun GitHub Wiki, just like any other repo. -->

> NOTE: The GitHub repo isn't necessarily easy to navigate (yet), so to make sense of what page is what, dig into [this code](https://github.com/gundb/gun-site/blob/master/docs/navigation.json) for reference.

Thanks for all the help!
