# Introduction

## Goal of this Guide

This document will detail different ways to introduce Gun into various existing technology stacks. It will also explain Gun concepts by relating it to other technology.

## Audience for this Guide

### Developers trying to Learn Gun

Some developers may be trying to conceptually understand how Gun works, but they understand web apps best in terms of the technology stack that they are most familiar with.

For example, you've been working with [LAMP stacks](#from-a-lamp-stack) for 20 years and you want to know what parts of the stack Gun can actually replace or enhance.

### Developers with Existing Apps

While it is nice to create a brand new app from scratch, some developers may be wondering how Gun can benefit their existing apps.

For example, maybe you just want to replace your user authentication with Gun and nothing else. Or maybe you want to keep your user authentication but you want to replace a specific component of your website like a user comment system.

# From a LAMP Stack

## Components

* Linux operating system
* Apache HTTP Server
* MySQL relational database management system (RDBMS)
* PHP programming language. 

## Where and How to Introduce Gun

### Example

# From a MEAN Stack

## Components

* MongoDB, a NoSQL database
* Express.js, a web application framework that runs on Node.js
* Angular.js or Angular, JavaScript MVC frameworks that run in browser JavaScript engines
* Node.js, an execution environment for event-driven server-side and networking applications

## Where and How to Introduce Gun

Gun can replace the MongoDB portion of this stack in regards to user authentication and data storage.

### Example

TODO: Give example code in a MEAN stack where you would handle login switching, etc and what parts of code you would replace with Gun API calls

# React (+ Vue & Angular coming soon)
