gist is.... Base64 by default, and if that errors like @bugs181 proposed it'll try UTF8, so old data readable all new data Base64 so seamless upgrade path (will only break if other peers if they get new data and they have not upgraded), shuffle attack will allow any old SEA formatted data to validate if it was updated before Jan 1 2019 (adjustable by you `SEA.opt.shuffle_attack` timestamp number, `SEA.opt.unpack` handles format switching) if new format fails to match, new format should have newer vectors and therefore take precedence. Not sure compatibility implications after Jan 1 2019 though. If somebody logs in on an account old format it'll work (but maybe not after Jan 1 2019 if not already upgraded, adjustable by you), and then attempt to automatically do a "change password" (using current password) that will re-save account data thus hopefully upgrading login/core-account info to new format (but nothing else, as I have no knowledge of other data, unless I start crawling and performing writes on every read, which would be bad), and I almost have logins on new format working correctly also. But keep in mind, any old peers will reject upgraded/migrated data as invalid, so there are easy breaking points. Migrating the rest of the data is probably also a good idea, but I'm not sure whether that'll be better than just letting it be hopefully working with backwards compatibility even if exposed to shuffle attacks.

Depending upon severity of migration, this page will be updated with more information to assist.
