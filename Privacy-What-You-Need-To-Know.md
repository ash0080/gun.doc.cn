If you share something with more than 5 people, you should not consider it private anymore.

This is **Entropy's Law of Privacy**, known as gossip.

Here is how it works. Researcher and social psychologist, Dr. Cazzell (Stanford, Queensland, BYU, Yale), excellently described it in her [Behavioral Economics](https://hackernoon.com/behavioral-cryptoeconomics-the-secret-of-digital-currencies-ac6e9b04fcb6) article with the Game of Clue:

When you reveal your card, that Professor Plum did not commit the murder, then the other person *also* learns that information. This seems obvious, but when you contrast that with physical things, it is oddly different. If I give you money, a cake, a car, or anything else, then I **lose** it and you **gain** it. This is not true with information, **both people gain** knowledge win+win - at no loss. Think how silly it would be if your brain forgot the card if you revealed it to someone else.

This is deeply profound.

It means that if you share information, it can never be taken back.

In this way, even if you use the best tools for privacy, any of your friends might gossip about it. So be careful.
