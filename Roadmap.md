Rough roadmap, subject to frequent change:

 - 0.9 final touches to core.

 - 1.0 last breaking changes.

Beyond 1.0 towards a new ERA:

 - Normalize need to sanitize and deterministically canonize HTML end-to-end for user input. 

 - SEA integration and any API breaking changes need to be finalized for MetaMask.

 - AXE needs to be tested against software relay and point-to-point WiFi routers.

 - Binary data for audio (music, podcasts, etc.), photos, videos, etc.
