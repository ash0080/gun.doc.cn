PTSD (Performance Testing Speed Development) is a development methodology like TDD (Test Driven Development) or Agile. It emphasizes quick performance tests on small snippets of code during development that are non-distracting and numbers based (irrelevant of any "best practices"). The goal is that the end product will be released sooner and benefit from significant performance advantages, even if the team did no explicit benchmark testing on the product directly.

In our case study, we achieved gains of millions of operations per second. To learn more, please watch the tech talk.
