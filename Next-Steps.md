We have split the documentation into several pages based on your needs:

## Application Developers

For people wanting to just get stuff done, you will want to start with:

1. Experiencing the [interactive tutorials](Todo-Dapp).
2. Then working your way through the [guide](Graph-Guide).
3. And then jumping into the [API documentation](API).

And don't forget to [watch the 2 minute crash course](Crash-Course)!

## Software Architects

You may want to learn about GUN's engineering and decide whether it is a good fit for your company. We recommend you:

1. Get a sense for our [CAP Theorem tradeoffs](CAP-Theorem).
2. Review the [performance benchmarks](100000-ops-sec-in-IE6-on-2GB-Atom-CPU).
3. See how the [graphs are structured](GUN%E2%80%99s-Data-Format-%28JSON%29).
4. Understand how the [conflict resolution algorithm works](Conflict-Resolution-with-Guns).
5. [Recreate GUN from scratch](Porting-GUN).

Hopefully this helps!
