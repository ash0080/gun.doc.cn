Here are some apps that showcase voting in GUN:

 - https://notabug.io/
 - https://gun-poll.now.sh/?poll=whatshouldnickdevelopnext ([code](https://github.com/nmaro/gun-poll))
 - https://edide.io/ksp.app

This page is a stub to discuss algorithmic considerations of voting (likes, hearts, etc.) & aggregation in distributed systems, these apps should also be listed on Awesome List.
